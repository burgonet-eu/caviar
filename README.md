This is a service for detecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in text.

## Getting Started

To run the service, download the binary on the [release page](https://github.com/burgonet-eu/caviar/releases)
and run it:

```bash
./caviar
```

The service will be available on port 8080.

The first time, the deep learning model will be downloaded, you will need around 600MB of free space available.

## Usage

Send a POST request to `/detect_pii` with a JSON payload containing the text to analyze:

```json
{
  "text": "Example text containing a name like John Doe or an email address like john.doe@example.com."
}
```

The service will return a JSON response containing the entities detected:

```json
{
  "entities": [
    {
      "word": "John Doe",
      "entity": "PERSON",
      "score": 0.95,
      "start": 30,
      "end": 38,
      "index": 5
    },
    {
      "word": "john.doe@example.com",
      "entity": "EMAIL",
      "score": 0.98,
      "start": 54,
      "end": 75,
      "index": 9
    }
  ]
}
```

## Configuration
